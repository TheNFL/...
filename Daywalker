Punch that motherfucker in the face
You hated what he said, right?
Beat his ass, leave him at the stoplight
I know you wanted change, but nobody's around
So, kick him again while he's on the ground, yo
I'll never be the same
I wanna know if I tell you a secret, will you keep it?
I need someone to blame (Take it!)
And I see somebody talkin' with the mouth that's full of teeth
I wanna break (Go)

Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, yeah, yeah

They tried to kill me in the rain
Tried to lay me down and so I ducked and ran away
Put a gun up to my face, I won't fucking catch a case (A case)
When I find this motherfucker then I'll lay him in his grave
All these fucking razorblades
I wanna know if I tell you a secret, will you keep it?
I will never be the same
I bit the fucking apple, I'm surrounded by some snakes (CORPSE)

Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight (Yeah, yeah), fight

Stay up, blade
Stay up

I prayed to God and then I went to sleep with bloody hands
Inside my room, I heard the sirens from the ambulance
I chipped my tooth and then I found a piece inside my pants
He talkin' shit, when he wake up, I go do that again
I came back
I wanna know if I tell you a secret, will you keep it?
If a pussy wanna say shit, then I'll fuckin' stomp his face in
Nah, not getting better, can't change it, I left blood all on the pavement
I'm on borrowed time, can't shake it, uh, blackout when I'm ragin', uh
Me and all these pills be on a fuckin' first name basis, uh
There's an invisible voice that is talkin' to me and it's always tellin' me to kill
I got a problem with separating what my head is creating from things that are real
I'm in a room, hyperventilating and debating to pop off the cap of these pills
If I get angry, I'm goin' to start up a riot like people on Capitol Hill

Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight (Yeah, yeah), fight
